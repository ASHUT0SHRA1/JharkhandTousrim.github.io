          The first thing that strikes you about Jagannath Temple is its
          resemblance to the temple in Puri. Located about 10 km from the main
          city, this 17th-century shrine is one of the most popular places in
          the city and is thus visited by innumerable tourists. The best time to
          visit the temple is undoubtedly during the Ratha Yatra which is held
          every year in the months of June-July. As the temple is built on a
          hill, you will have to climb several stairs to reach there. After
          seeking blessings, donâ€™t forget to spend a few minutes enjoying the
          splendid views of the city from the top.
